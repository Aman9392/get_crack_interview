# Cogni – Undetectable AI for macOS

Cogni lets you run a fully local AI interface on your macOS desktop — private, lightweight, and free.  

No subscriptions. No data collection. No unnecessary noise.



## Why Cogni?

### Local-First, Free Forever  
Unlike cloud-based alternatives, Cogni runs entirely on your machine. That means no recurring fees, no server downtime, and no risk of data leaks.  

### Invisible by Design  
Cogni stays hidden during screen sharing, recordings, or virtual meetings. You can work without leaving visible traces.  


## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you don’t already have it.
2. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, then update any values as needed.  
3. In your terminal, run:  

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
