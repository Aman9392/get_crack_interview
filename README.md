# 🧠 Cogni – Undetectable AI for Your macOS Screen

Cogni lets you **browse Invisible AI** right on your macOS desktop – totally incognito and completely **free**.

No nags. No fees. No evidence. Just smooth, stealthy intelligence.

## 🚀 Why Cogni?

### 💸 Better than Cluely

Cluely? Cute. But Cogni is **local-first** and **free forever**.  
No cloud fees, no data leaks, no "Oops, our server is down."

### 🕵️ Incognito Mode

Screen sharing with your boss? No worries.  
Cogni won't show up in recordings, screenshots, or virtual meetings.  

> \*Okay maybe not _legally_ reviewed yet, but hey 🤷‍♂️

## 🛠️ How to Start

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. (If not: [Get Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
2. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

Boom. That’s it. No fluff.

## 🍏 Why no macOS app?

> I'm too broke to pay Apple $99/year to distribute this as an official app.  
> So until someone gifts me a developer license (or a pizza), we're keeping it real with `npm start`.
